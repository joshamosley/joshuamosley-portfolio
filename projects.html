                    <h3>Portfolio Optimization Function Using Python</h3>
                    <p>This project presents the development and implementation of a portfolio optimization tool leveraging Python and key financial libraries such as PyPortfolioOpt and yfinance. By combining Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) with efficient computational methods, the tool enables users to construct an optimal portfolio, maximize returns, and minimize risks. The system integrates data fetching, optimization, allocation, and visualization, providing a comprehensive framework for portfolio management.

                    <h3>Applied Econometrics: Parent Expectations on Academic Outcomes</h3>
                    <p>In this Econometrics Final Project, I investigated how a parent's academic expectations influence a child's academic outcomes, focusing on the interplay between familial expectations and student performance. I conducted an extensive literature review to understand existing theories and empirical findings on the topic, drawing from fields such as developmental psychology and educational sociology. Using data from surveys and longitudinal studies, I analyzed how variations in parental expectations—both supportive and overly demanding—affected academic achievement, motivation, and self-esteem in children. The paper also explored how socioeconomic factors and cultural differences mediate these relationships. My findings emphasized the importance of balanced, realistic expectations in fostering positive educational outcomes and personal growth in students.</p>

                    <h3>Corporate Finance: Agrivoltaics Research</h3>
                    <p>In my Corporate Finance class, my team and I conducted an in-depth analysis of Agri Voltaics, exploring its financial viability and sustainability potential. We investigated how integrating solar panels with agricultural activities could optimize land use, generate renewable energy, and provide additional income streams for farmers. Our research included financial modeling to assess the capital expenditure, operational costs, and projected revenues from energy production and crop yields. We also evaluated potential funding sources, tax incentives, and regulatory frameworks to understand the investment landscape. By integrating financial analysis with sustainability metrics, we presented a comprehensive case for Agri Voltaics as an innovative and economically feasible solution for the energy and agriculture sectors.</p>

                    <h3>Quantum Mechanics: Hydrogen Atom Lesson</h3>
                    <p>I delivered a lecture on the hydrogen atom in Quantum Mechanics, focusing on its pivotal role as a model system for understanding atomic structure. The session began with an overview of the Schrödinger equation as applied to hydrogen, emphasizing the separation of variables in spherical coordinates. I guided the audience through the derivation of energy eigenvalues and the quantization of angular momentum, highlighting their physical significance. The lecture concluded with applications of the hydrogen atom model in spectroscopy and its broader implications in modern physics.</p>

                    <h3>Quantum Mechanics: Electron Diffraction Lab</h3>
                    <p>In this lab we observed the structure of Carbon Graphite by shooting a beam of electrons through said Graphite and onto a screen – utilizing the wave-like properties of an electron. Then we measure the inner and outer ring’s diameter at each voltage and graphed the data to illustrate the linear relationship between diameter and √V</p>

                    <h3>Microeconomics Research: 2008 Recession Technology</h3>
                    <p>In my research on the aesthetic changes in consumer technology during the years surrounding the 2008 Recession, I examined how economic, cultural, and technological factors influenced design trends. By analyzing devices such as smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics, I observed a shift toward minimalist aesthetics, reflecting a cultural pivot to practicality and efficiency amid economic uncertainty. I explored how manufacturers adopted streamlined designs, muted color palettes, and premium-feeling materials to convey durability and value. By integrating design analysis with economic context, my research highlighted how the recession reshaped consumer preferences and industry innovation.</p>
